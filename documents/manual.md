# KitaMatch - Manual

- Code API: /docs/build/index.html
- Database manual: db_manual.md

KitaMatch is an app that solves the allocation of day-care places in an innovative way. The application would like to offer a holistic implementation: from the registration of parents and kindergartens, the matching procedure to the municipal administration and communication of the matching results.
It uses modern matching algorithms to design the allocation procedure in such a way that queues in front of kindergartens will be unnecessary and parents indicate their true preferences. This is possible because the implemented procedure is strategy proof, by the use of the deferred acceptance algorithm.


## Matching
For the matching procedure KitaMatch mainly uses the deferred acceptance algorithm from MatchingTools API (https://matchingtools.com/). The Deferred Acceptance Algorithm for hospital/residents problems (a.k.a. college admissions problems) finds the college- or student-optimal stable matchings or the related stable marriage problem. The implementation allows for incomplete preference lists (some agents find certain agents unacceptable) and unbalanced instances (unequal number of agents on both sides).  
The API is based on the R-package matchingMarkets (https://github.com/thiloklein/matchingMarkets).

## Code

Basically KitaMatch is structured, like every MVC model, into three main parts: controllers ('app/Http/Controllers/..'), models ('app/..') and views (resources/views/..). If you have some questions about the overall code structure or where you can find certain elements, the best starting point is the Laravel Documentation (https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/), cause KitaMatch core is based on the framework.

### Code Helper

#### Laravel Plugins

##### Laravel Migrations Generator
All migrations of KitaMatch are generated by the plugin of Bernhard Breytenbach.
The plugin description states: "Automatically generate your migrations from an existing database schema", more Information see: https://github.com/Xethron/migrations-generator. (used version: v2.0.2, 2017-09-19)
Run: 'php artisan migrate:generate'

#### Database
The database scheme and the EER-Diagram have been created with MySQLWorkbench (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), to get a more detailed view about the scheme have a look at 'db_eer_diagram.mwb' with MySQLWorkbench.

#### Documentation API
KitaMatch's API is based on Sami (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami). To update or rebuild the documentation, run 'php sami.phar update sami.config.php' in the root directory of the project. For a detailed look at the configuration look into 'sami.config.php'.
